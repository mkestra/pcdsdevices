- Four blade SXR solid attenuator (AT1K4 and AT2K2) screens have been updated
  to include all of the filters installed on each blade. It will also show the
  per-blade filters that the calculator will insert when "Apply Configuration"
  is clicked. The custom energy line edit will now remain visible regardless of
  the "Actual/Custom" Photon Energy selection.
